Diagram for case one and two
Explain mesa-optimisers better
Explain why the base objective only cares about the current training episode
Explicitly assume that the mesa objective doesn't depend on the input.
Pseudocode for experiments
Demonstration of gradient descent trough optimiser
Argue that a small deviation toward base objective means that mesa objective will be changed less.
